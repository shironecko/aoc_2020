# Advent of Code 2020

Just my collection of solutions for AoC 2020 made whilst learning Rust language.

Note that my inputs for puzzles are not included since author of AoC discourages that.

## Requirements
* rustc version at least **nightly 1.50.0**
* puzzle inputs in the ```./input``` folder named ```day_00.txt```, ```day_01.txt``` etc.
